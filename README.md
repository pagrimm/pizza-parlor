# Pizza Parlor
**Week 4 Project for Epicodus**  
**By Peter Grimm, 06.19.2020**

## Description

Week 4 project for Epicodus: A website for a pizza parlor where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost. Designed to showcase what I've learned about constructors, prototypes, objects, properties, methods, jQuery and DOM manipulation and traversal.
